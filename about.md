Hi! :wave:

My name is Diogo. I'm a machine learning PhD student, based in Portugal :portugal:

Throughout my computer science career, I've learned to program in many programming languages, with multiple paradigms, tools, and libraries. I've started my journey 10 years ago!

As a tutor, my goal is to make programming approachable and fun for everyone. Focusing on helping beginners lift off their programming journey, I’m here to guide you every step of the way. I believe in learning by doing, and I’ll work with you to tackle real-world problems, so you can develop the skills you need to succeed. 

I've taken many students in the past, from all around the world :earth_americas:. I have a flexible schedule that will certainly accomodate your time restrictions. I usually book 1-hour online lessons, and always leave you with some homework so you can practice in-between lessons. I'm usually pretty fast in replying to your emails with any questions regarding the homework -- I also hate those "feeling stuck" moments.

If you want to start your programming journey with `Python`, `P5js`, or `C`, shoot me an email at [tutormeprogramming@gmail.com](mailto:tutormeprogramming@gmail.com) so we can start the conversation!

Make sure to checkout my website for some of the projects I've taken on with my students. You could be the next one to implement them!
