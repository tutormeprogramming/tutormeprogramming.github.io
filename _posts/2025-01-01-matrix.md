Youâ€™ve seen it in the movie: streams of green text raining down on a dark screen, like the Matrix itself. We'll bring that iconic effect to life in code in a simple visualizer! ðŸ’»âœ¨

Weâ€™re going to break it down and build it step-by-step, so you understand how it works under the hood.

Hereâ€™s the plan:
1.	Start with the basics: Weâ€™ll begin by creating a simple green rectangle that falls down like rain and loops back to the top, giving a sense of infinite-like looping.
2.	Expand for multiple streams: Next, weâ€™ll expand our single rectangle falling down to multiple, random rectangles.
3.	Adding the Matrix look: Once the basic animation is in place, weâ€™ll tweak the appearance. That means exchanging the rectangles for streams of random text, have some letters randomly change, and that trademark green glow around the text.
