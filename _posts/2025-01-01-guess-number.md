This is a classic exercise: you write a program that picks a random number within a given range (say, between 0 and 100), and the user has to guess it. With each wrong guess, the program tells the user if the guess is too high or too low, and the game continues until the correct number is found.

But hereâ€™s where we make things more interesting. Instead of the program selecting the number, you (the user) pick the number, and the program has to guess it! ðŸ§ 

This twist brings in an exciting new challenge. How will you program the computer to guess your number? Should it always pick the middle number in the current range? Or maybe it should start with the most commonly chosen numbers first? There are endless strategies to explore!

Iâ€™ll guide you through designing different approaches, from search-like strategies to more complex algorithms that improve over time. The goal is to build an intelligent program that can quickly and efficiently guess any number you throw at it -- while you learn valuable concepts like loops and optimization.

By the end, youâ€™ll not only have a fun game, but youâ€™ll also have deepened your understanding of algorithms and problem-solving. Letâ€™s dive into the code and make our program smarter with every guess!
