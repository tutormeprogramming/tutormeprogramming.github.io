Do you know the classic *Space Invaders* game, where you control a spaceship and fight off waves of invading aliens? The goal is to defend your base and shoot down as many aliens as possible! We'll build it together from the ground up ðŸš€

Hereâ€™s the plan:
1.	Basic movement: Weâ€™ll start by implementing your spaceship. It moves left and right and can shoot lasers. Simple, right? But itâ€™s important to get this core mechanic down before we add complexity.
2.	Alien invasion: Next, weâ€™ll add our alien invaders -- rows of enemies that move across the screen and drop down at regular intervals. Itâ€™s all about handling enemy movement and collision detection.
3.	Wave after wave: Now, letâ€™s ramp things up! Weâ€™ll make the aliens more challenging by having them move faster and adding new patterns. The game becomes more intense with each wave, so weâ€™ll focus on creating scalable code to keep up with the action.

Along the way, Iâ€™ll show you how to break down the game into smaller, bite-sized tasks, keeping everything manageable while still learning powerful concepts like game loops, collision detection, and animation.
