You probably remember the iconic Flappy Bird game. Weâ€™re going to build it together! ðŸŽ®

When tackling projects like this, I like to follow a divide and conquer approach. Rather than diving straight into the full game, weâ€™ll break it down into smaller, manageable chunks. This makes complex problems easier to solve, and gives us a clearer sense of progress as we go.

Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ll build it step-by-step:
1.	Start with the basics: First, weâ€™ll get the bird (a simple dot) to jump. This lays the foundation for the core mechanics.
2.	Add obstacles: Next, weâ€™ll introduce a single pipe coming towards the bird. This teaches the concept of collision detection and movement.
3.	Make it dynamic: After that, weâ€™ll implement infinite, randomly generated pipes. This is where the game starts to take shape and become challenging!

Throughout the project, Iâ€™ll guide you step-by-step, explaining each decision and how to approach problem-solving. The goal is for you to understand not just how to code, but why certain patterns and strategies are used.

And of course, no game is complete without a bit of polish. By the end, weâ€™ll learn how to upload and display our own images to make the game visually sharp and engaging!
